I am a theoretical neuroscientist and PhD candidate at Columbia University in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), primarily advised by Larry Abbott.

<span style="color:magenta">**Update:**</span>
Starting Fall 2025, I will be a research fellow at the [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Please get in touch if you would like to collaborate!

Neural circuits are characterized by their large scale, nonlinear dynamics, complex recurrent interactions, and connections that change across multiple timescales. I use tools from statistical physics and machine learning to understand how these features enable computation and learning.

My publications are listed below, or see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Fxo16MAAAAJ).

Outside of science, I see a lot of Broadway and enjoy juggling.
