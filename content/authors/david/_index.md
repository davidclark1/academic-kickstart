I am a neuroscience graduate student at Columbia University, advised by [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) and [Richard Axel](https://www.axellab.columbia.edu/). I work in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/).

Using tools from math, physics, and computer science, I aim to understand how biological and artificial neural circuits function and learn.

Prior to graduate school, I worked with Kristofer Bouchard in the [Neural Systems and Data Science Lab](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
