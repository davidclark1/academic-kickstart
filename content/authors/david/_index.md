I am a **theoretical neuroscientist** and research fellow at the [Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.  

Neural circuits are characterized by their large scale, nonlinear dynamics, complex recurrent interactions, and connections that change across multiple timescales. I use tools from statistical physics and machine learning to understand how these features enable computation and learning.

I earned my Ph.D. in Neurobiology and Behavior from Columbia University in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), where I was primarily advised by Larry Abbott and worked closely with Ashok Litwin-Kumar and Haim Sompolinsky. Before that, I studied physics and computer science at UC Berkeley.

Outside of science, I see a lot of Broadway.
